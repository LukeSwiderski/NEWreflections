When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remore repository when I'm working from a different computer, or if I'm working with someone else on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because someone else might be working on your repository and you would receive changes that you aren't ready for.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a repo on github's servers.  A clone is a copy of a repo on a local machine.  A branch is a diversion of commits from the master.  You would use a fork when you want to copy someone elses repo.  You would use a clone when you want to copy a repo on your own computer.  You would use branch when you want to experiment and make changes without affecting the master.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remore repository when I'm working from a different computer, or if I'm working with someone else on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because someone else might be working on your repository and you would receive changes that you aren't ready for.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a repo on github's servers.  A clone is a copy of a repo on a local machine.  A branch is a diversion of commits from the master.  You would use a fork when you want to copy someone elses repo.  You would use a clone when you want to copy a repo on your own computer.  You would use branch when you want to experiment and make changes without affecting the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you know where you left off in case someone worked on your repo while you were offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You would have to send files via email and describe what lines are different.  It would be easier in that you didn't have to learn git or github.  It would be harder because there would be more steps involved, and a lot less tools available to compare the files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Making changes in a separate branch allows you the freedom to make mistakes that wont affect the master.  Maing changes to the master has the benefit of not having to merge anything.
